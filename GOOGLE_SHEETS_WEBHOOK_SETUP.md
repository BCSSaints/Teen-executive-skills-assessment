# Google Sheets Webhook Integration - Simple Setup Guide

## üéØ Overview
The easiest way to integrate Google Sheets with your Teen Executive Skills Assessment is using Google Apps Script as a webhook. This approach requires no complex authentication and works reliably.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Google Apps Script Webhook
1. **Go to:** https://script.google.com
2. **Click:** "New Project"
3. **Name it:** "Executive Skills Assessment Webhook"
4. **Replace the default Code.gs content** with the code from `google-apps-script-webhook.js`
5. **Update the SPREADSHEET_ID** in line 13:
   ```javascript
   const SPREADSHEET_ID = '1xnFF9gPsx9KO51E6SkMOcqyDISCEr_nsD6UkPdCMbTI';
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy as Web App
1. **Click:** "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
2. **Type:** "Web app"
3. **Description:** "Executive Skills Assessment Data Handler"
4. **Execute as:** "Me"
5. **Who has access:** "Anyone" (this is safe - it only accepts assessment data)
6. **Click:** "Deploy"
7. **Copy the Web App URL** (looks like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/ABC123.../exec`)

### Step 3: Configure Cloudflare Secret
```bash
echo "your-web-app-url-here" | npx wrangler pages secret put GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL --project-name executive-skills-assessment
```

### Step 4: Test Integration
1. **Visit:** https://your-assessment-url.pages.dev/api/test-sheets
2. **Check your Google Sheet** for test data
3. **Take a sample assessment** to verify live sync

## üìä What Happens Automatically

### When Students Complete Assessments:
1. **Assessment data is sent** to your Google Apps Script webhook
2. **Script creates/updates** the "Assessment Results" sheet in your Google Sheets
3. **Headers are automatically added** if they don't exist
4. **Data is formatted and inserted** as a new row
5. **You can analyze results immediately** in Google Sheets

### Data Structure in Google Sheets:
| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| A-E | Basic info (timestamp, name, email, grade, school) |
| F-AK | Individual responses (Q1-Q33) |
| AL-AV | Category scores (11 executive skills) |
| AW-BB | Analysis results (overall score, strengths, weaknesses) |

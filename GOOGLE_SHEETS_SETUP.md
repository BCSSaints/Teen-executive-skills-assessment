## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Google Sheet
1. **Go to Google Sheets:** https://sheets.google.com
2. **Create a new blank spreadsheet**
3. **Name it:** "Executive Skills Assessment Results - BCS Saints"
4. **Copy the Spreadsheet ID** from the URL:
   - URL looks like: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit`
   - Copy the `SPREADSHEET_ID` part (long string of letters/numbers)

### Step 2: Get Google Sheets API Key
1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:** https://console.cloud.google.com
2. **Create a new project** (or select existing):
   - Project name: "BCS Saints Assessments"
3. **Enable Google Sheets API:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. **Create API Key:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "API Key"
   - **Copy the API key** (keep it secure!)
5. **Restrict the API Key (IMPORTANT for security):**
   - Click on your API key to edit it
   - Under "API restrictions" â†’ "Restrict key"
   - Select "Google Sheets API"
   - Save changes

### Step 3: Make Google Sheet Accessible
1. **Open your Google Sheet**
2. **Click "Share" button** (top right)
3. **Change permissions:**
   - Click "Change to anyone with the link"
   - Set to "Viewer" (not Editor)
   - This allows the API to read the sheet structure

### Step 4: Configure Cloudflare Secrets
1. **Add your API key as a Cloudflare secret:**
   ```bash
   echo "your-google-api-key-here" | npx wrangler pages secret put GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY --project-name executive-skills-assessment
   ```

2. **Add your Spreadsheet ID as a secret:**
   ```bash
   echo "your-spreadsheet-id-here" | npx wrangler pages secret put GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID --project-name executive-skills-assessment
   ```

### Step 5: Test the Integration
1. **Visit the test endpoint:** https://your-assessment-url.pages.dev/api/test-sheets
2. **Check for success message** and verify test data appears in your Google Sheet
3. **Take a sample assessment** to confirm live sync is working

## ðŸ“‹ Example Google Sheet Structure

Your sheet will automatically be formatted with these columns:

| A | B | C | D | E | F-AK | AL-AV | AW | AX | AY |
|---|---|---|---|---|------|-------|----|----|-----|
| Date | Name | Email | Grade | School | Q1-Q33 | Category Scores | Overall | Strengths | Weaknesses |

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Google Sheets not configured" error:**
- Check that both `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID` secrets are set
- Verify the API key is valid and has Google Sheets API access

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Make sure your Google Sheet is shared with "Anyone with the link can view"
- Check that your API key has Google Sheets API enabled

**"Spreadsheet not found" error:**
- Verify the Spreadsheet ID is correct (long string from the URL)

**Headers not appearing:**
